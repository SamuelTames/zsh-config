## Install

# pull the git repo to correct location
git clone https://github.com/SamuelTames/zsh-config.git ~/.zsh-config

# setup fzf (debian buster has fzf in the repo)
sudo apt install fzf
curl -o "~/zsh-config/lib/fzf/completion.zsh" \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/fzf/master/shell/completion.zsh

curl -o "~/zsh-config/lib/fzf/key-bindings.zsh" \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/fzf/master/shell/key-bindings.zsh

# setup antibody (if you're comfortable with piping scripts to your shell.)
# Alternatively, your distro may have it packaged. It's also available as a snap.
# https://getantibody.github.io/install/
curl -sL git.io/antibody | sh -s

# link the zsh config files to their expected location in ${HOME}
sh ~/.zsh-config/install
